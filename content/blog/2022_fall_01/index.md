Hello Cybersecurity UW!

We hope everyone is having a good start to the Fall 2022 semester! Our Kickoff meeting will be on Wednesday 9/21, from 5:30pm to 6:30pm. We are still figuring out the location, but it should be in the CS building. We will send an email with the location later this week.

At this meeting, we will go over "Open Source Intelligence". Ever wonder how much information you can find online? Find out through this meeting! We will first do a brief introduction and a demo on different kinds of Open Source Intelligence, mainly focused on using publicly available sources to harvest information about a target. Then, we will be doing a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) style challenge on identifying coordinates of images taken on campus. This fun activity will show how just a picture could be used to find the location of a target. Come and meet up with fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts and have fun!

Lastly, we wanted to announce that we will be at the Student Organization Fair! Stop by the Kohl Center from 5pm-8pm on Tuesday 9/13 and Wednesday 9/14 to learn more about the club!

We're excited to start the semester strong, and we look forward to seeing you at the meeting!

Best,
Cybersecurity UW Leadership Team
