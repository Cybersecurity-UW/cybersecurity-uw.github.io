The next meeting will be on Wednesday 3/24 at 5:30 pm via the Microsoft Teams link below.
We will be experimenting with this [card-game API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com) at and having our first Hacker Discussion

Google Description - "API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API." It is very important as most tech companies are switching

If you would like a GUI option for the API tutorial, consider installing Postman.
