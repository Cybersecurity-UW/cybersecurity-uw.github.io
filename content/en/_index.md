Cybersecurity UW (CSEC) is a student organization that allows its members to learn and explore security in a collaborative environment. This includes everything from security research to lessons on online privacy and safety.

Our club has many goals we are trying to achieve and some of the following are:

- Discussion room based on hacking subjects (Such as the NSA codebreaker and hack the box)
- Teach skills relevant to cybersecurity
- Enable a collaborative environment for cybersecurity based team projects
- Learn how to manage your digital footprint and shared online information
- Create an environment for people to explore and experiment with security
- Host events to help share information with the general public

UW Cybersecurity club is focused on both students with and without Cybersecurity experience. Having experience with programming and Linux/Unix will help with some activities in the club. We enable cybersecurity enthusiasts to collaborate on research and discovery, and to teach cybersecurity beginners how to run and use (white-hat) hacking programs (like metasploit) and other cybersecurity relavent tools (such as API's). If you are interested in joining, please [reach out to us](/contact)!
