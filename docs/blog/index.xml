      <description>Hello Cybersecurity UW!
We hope everyone is having a good start to the Fall 2022 semester! Our Kickoff meeting will be on Wednesday 9/21, from 5:30pm to 6:30pm. We are still figuring out the location, but it should be in the CS building. We will send an email with the location later this week.
At this meeting, we will go over &amp;ldquo;Open Source Intelligence&amp;rdquo;. Ever wonder how much information you can find online?</description>
