      <description>Cybersecurity UW was founded in the Information School at 2019. Since then, we have focused on various cybersecurity topics.
Membership Requirements # Anyone can join our club. Cybersecurity UW wants to try and include everyone who is interested. This is why the club is open to everyone including undergraduate and graduate students, minors and students who are not at UW-Madison.
Itâ€™s also not required to make every meeting.
